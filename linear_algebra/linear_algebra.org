** TODO This is just to get started, need to organize for PVS theories

* Determinants
There are a number of approaches to defining determinants

- Cullen, Chapter 3. uses elementary matrices and the characterization
  det(AB) = det(A)det(B) and det(I) = 1

- Shilov, Chapter 1. uses summation over permutations
